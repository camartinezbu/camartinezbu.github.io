{{< lead >}}
My name is Camilo Marrtínez  Burgos :man_technologist:
{{< /lead >}}

I am passionate about data science and programming.

I believe that data is key to understanding the world. I want more people and organizations to be able to apply the analysis tools used by this discipline to improve the well-being of everyone.

I studied my undergraduate degree in economics at the Universidad del Rosario and I have a Master's degree in Economic Sciences from the National University of Colombia. I also have complementary studies in Global Challenges and Innovation in Public Policy from Florida International University and in Leadership and Innovation from MIT Professional Education.

Additionally, I have knowledge of tools such as R, Python, Git and Github, PostgreSQL, Docker, among others.

I have more than 6 years of experience working on policy analysis issues in Colombia. I have served as an Economic Advisor at the National Trade Council and as a Smart Cities and Urban Security Analyst at ProBogotá Region and I currently work as an Innovation, Data Analytics and Public Policy Consultant.
