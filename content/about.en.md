I am passionate about data science and programming.
{{< /lead >}}

I'm an economist from Universidad del Rosario and I have a Master's degree in Economic Sciences from the National University of Colombia. I work at the intersection between public policy, applied economics and data science.

I am proficient at programming languages like R and Python, as well as tools like Git, SQL, Docker, among others.

I have worked at organizations like the National Business Council, Probogotá Región, the CityLab at Bogota's District Department of Planning and [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-storytelling-case-study-green-businesses). I was also assistant professor of Computational Methods for Public Policy at Universidad del Rosario. I currently work as Consultant of Innovation, Data Analysis and Public Polilcy, as well as Contractor at the District Deparment of Security, Peaceful Coexistence and Justice.
